This is the Week 4 jQuery assignment.

For this homework I have chosen to develop the CrystalCollector game to better grasp the application and concepts of jQuery.

The game consists of 4 on-click images of different gems.  Each gem is assigned a randomized value from 1-12 and a target value is generated from 19-120.  The player is then tasked with pressing each gem to increase the current score by the fixed amount held by that individual score.  If the player is able to reach the exact target score, they win the game.
